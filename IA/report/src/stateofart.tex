Today, there are numerous papers around the
strip-packing problem, which implies that is not possible
to consider all of them, including all the meta-heuristics,
and heuristics methods.

A complete compendium of the most representative
solution to the present problem can be found in the work
presented in \cite{hooper},
additionally the work presented by \cite{riff},
show a brief and simple analysis of some important
papers between both published dates.

This section aims to collect some actual good approaches
to solve the strip-packing problem.

\subsection{Heuristics}

\subsubsection{Based on best-fit heuristic}

In the work presented by \cite{burke}
a new methodology was presented which modify the
way to determine the penalization of each item position.

The base methodology is find the difficult items (high penalty),
and use them first, leaving the easiest items (low penalty)
positioning, to the end of the algorithm.

The algorithm search the item positions which break bound
constraints and assign it a penalization based on the existing
penalization plus the size of the height (considering filling the space
from above).

\subsection{Meta-heuristics}

\subsubsection{Non-based on bottom-left heuristic}

There are some publications which provides a very clever
approach to solve this problem.
When a researcher start to think in a new method for
solving any optimization problem, take as basis
the best results in the literature,
but in some cases, the authors think in a whole new way
to find a solution, which is the case of \cite{neveu},
that provide a method starting from one of the most critic
issues solving the problem, the blank-spaces.

In the literature is possible to find methods to avoid
this blank-spaces (holes), re-adjusting the pieces,
or adding a penalization, but this works presented the
idea of maintain a set of maximizes blank-spaces in the
process of adding new items.
The key, is that maintaining blank-spaces allows the
algorithm to not modify the entire solution when a item
is removed, reducing this algorithm cost,
which in other cases is a critical factor.



\subsection{Exact methods}

One of the exact methods to solve the strip-packing problem,
is the branch and bound approach,
which only consider solutions using all the necessary items
to fill the entire space.
The idea behind this approach, is solve the situations when
is not possible to add a new item in the space,
without generate an empty space (hole),
so the algorithm start to cut branches.

In the presented work by \cite{alvarez},
the focus is over add new conditions to the strips,
to be able to generate better solutions,
also reduces the problem to different knapsack problems using the slides,
before apply the lower bounds.
Almost all the main ideas of the implementations,
are based on the work presented by \cite{martello},
chiefly the idea of use computed lower bound,
relaxing some constraints of the items surface,
dividing each item in slides to search solutions
more easily, but also considering that at the end of the algorithm,
is essential to join all the slides of the different items.
