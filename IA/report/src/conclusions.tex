We presented  a brief review for the two-dimensional strip-packing
considering different approaches to obtain an optimized solution.

The idea of the next work is improve and expand this current review,
and propose a new method, using the best ideas of the literature
focused on solving the presented problem.

Finally,
we can obtain a simple scenario
of some possibilities to start a new methodology
to solve the strip-packing problem,
considering different sections of the algorithm;
the heuristic to insert the new items,
a global technique to start to manipulate the items
position proposal, and the movement of this technique.

The publications described above
has one important characteristic, which make the difference
with other papers in the same topic,
the idea is to combine some described ideas for create a whole
new methodology.
